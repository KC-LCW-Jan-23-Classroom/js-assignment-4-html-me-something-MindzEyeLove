        <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">₿itcoin is seen as the future of freedom due to its censorship-resistance, freedom from financial repressions, and emergence as the natural successor to gold as a store of value. The technological advancements being born through ₿itcoin and other blockchain technologies is truly revolutionary. This page is intended to be a basic beginners guide to understanding ₿itcoin, Blockchain, and the future of financial freedom through sovereignty and personal responsibility. <strong><em>This article is NOT financial advice, it is only intended for educational purposes.</em></strong></p>

            <h2>So, What Is A Blockchain Anyway?</h2>
            <P>In simple terms, a blockchain is a public ledger that records bits(blocks) of information and stores them within a series(chain) of nodes(computers) in a peer to peer network. This differs from traditional information sharing techniques primarily due to is decentralized nature. This means that the entire network history is recorded and stored transparently by individual people(more accuratley, individual nodes), instead of centralized, privatized, corporate data centers. Check out this handy diagram below to illustrate.</p>

            <h2>So, What Is ₿itcoin?</h2>
            <p>
               ₿itcoin(₿TC) is a peer to peer digital cash with instantaneous transaction settlement. It operates without the need for a third party intermediary and all transactions are stored on a public ledger, aka a blockchain. It became known as a "cryptocurrency" because the transactions are secured and verified by using advanced cryptography. ₿itcoin has more recently become one of the leading forms of "high time-preference" store of value due to the fact that there are only 21 million ₿TC available. This is hard-coded into the protocol. Currently, approximately 19 million have already been mined, and it is estimated that the last one will be mined around the year 2140. There is much more information available about how ₿TC breaks down into <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-is-bitcoin/">smaller increments</a>, and <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/what-happens-when-all-21-million-bitcoin-are-mined">what happens when all ₿itcoins have been mined?</a>

<h2>The Importance Of Censorship-Resistance</h2>
<p>
To best illustrate this concept, we will refer to a recent article from bitcoin.com, where the guest author states, 
"<h3>The Three Pillars of Censorship Resistance</h3>
In the financial context, censorship resistance is the ability to carry out financial actions despite the wishes of any third party.

In crypto, the three pillars of censorship resistance are:
<ol>
   <li><h4>The freedom to transact.</h4>This means third parties cannot prevent you from sending or receiving assets.</li>
   <li><h4>The freedom from confiscation.</h4>Third parties cannot take away or freeze your assets.</li>
   <li><h4>The immutability of transactions.</h4>It is impossible for third parties to change or revert transactions after the fact.</li>
</ol>
Troubling actions increasingly taken by centralized entities in the public and private sector demonstrate the importance of censorship resistance. Let&#39;s look at some examples:" Some very important examples are given in the article and I highly suggest you read the full article <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/dont-forget-the-importance-of-censorship-resistance/">here</a>.

            <h2>A Case For Blockchain Technologies</h2>
            <p>
               Blockchain technology is one of the fastest growing industries in the tech world. We have really only scratched the surface of what can be accomplished, and as more projects and use cases develop, we are going to see massive shifts in the way we interact with the world around us. Everything from finance, healthcare, real estate, to voting systems can benefit from this emerging technology. And many more use cases that have yet to be discovered.

            <li>The creator of ₿itcoin is an anonymous entity known as Satoshi Nakamoto. To investigate the full story, <a href="https://youtu.be/udUydSKMcUM">click here</a>.</li>
            <li>There is a copy of the ₿itcoin White Paper hidden in every Macbook(2018 and newer). To find this "easter egg", <a href="https://waxy.org/2023/04/the-bitcoin-whitepaper-is-hidden-in-every-modern-copy-of-macos/">click here</a>.</li>
            <li>May 22nd is celebrated as <em>₿itcoin Pizza Day</em>. On May 22, 2010, a programmer named Laszlo, successfully traded 10,000 ₿itcoins for two Papa John&#39;s Pizzas. That was the first purchase done ever by using ₿itcoins. At that particular time, 10,000 ₿itcoins were worth approximately about $41. Now, these 10,000 ₿itcoins are worth over $64 million.  </li>
